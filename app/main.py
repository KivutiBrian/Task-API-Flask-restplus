Response marshalling - provides an easy way to control what data you actually render in your response or
expect as input in the payload. Using the fields module. also format and filter the response .

The decorator marshal_with() is what actually takes your data object and applies field filtering.
The marshalling can work on single objects, dicts, or lists of objects.

An optional envelope keyword argument is specified to wrap the resulting output.

Namespaces appear to be intended for organizing REST endpoints within a given API, 

Namespaces are optional, and add a bit of additional organisational touch to the API,
mainly, from a documentation point of view.
A namespace allows you to group related Resources under a common root, and is simple to create:

To bring certain Resources under a given namespace, all you need to do, is to replace @api with @ns_conf. 
Notice also that the name of the namespace replaces the name of the resource, 
so endpoints can simply to refer to /, instead of copying the name of the resource time and again
